This repository contains code and documentation for a time series analysis project. The project aims to analyze and forecast time series data using various techniques and models in Python.

Features
Data Preparation: Clean and preprocess time series data, handle missing values, and convert data into appropriate formats.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore temporal patterns, trends, and seasonality in the time series data using visualizations and statistical methods.
Modeling: Implement various time series models including ARIMA and machine learning-based approaches for forecasting.
Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. Compare different models and select the best-performing one.
Visualization: Visualize forecasted values along with historical data to assess model accuracy and make informed decisions.
